# Welcome to [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!

To start the slide show:

- `pnpm install` or `npm install`
- `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`
- visit <http://localhost:3030>
- If the build fails with a Vite config error, remove or temporarily rename vite.config.ts as Slidev merges its own config internally.

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes.

If you run into a Vite config issue, try temporarily moving vite.config.ts out of the way and attempt to build again.

Learn more about Slidev at the [documentation](https://sli.dev/).
